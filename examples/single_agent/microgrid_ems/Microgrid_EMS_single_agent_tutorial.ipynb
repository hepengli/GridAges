    "During simulation:\n",
    "- At each environment step, the simulator advances the dataset by one time index.\n",
    "- The agent observes only the **current values** of load, renewable availability, and price.\n",
    "- Future values are not revealed to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, uncertainty is introduced by:\n",
    "- sampling a **random start time** (e.g., a random day) from the one-year dataset at `reset()`,\n",
    "- rolling forward sequentially through the dataset within each episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach exposes the agent to a wide range of realistic operating conditions\n",
    "while preserving **temporal correlations** in load, renewable generation, and prices,\n",
    "which are critical in power system operations and difficult to capture with simple noise models.\n",
